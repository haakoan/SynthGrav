# ![SynthGrav Icon](icons8-frequency-64.png) SynthGrav: A Python Package for Core-Collapse Supernovae and Gravitational Wave Astronomy

## Overview
## Overview

SynthGrav is designed to facilitate machine learning applications, parameter estimation studies, and other data analysis tasks in the field of Core-Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) and Gravitational Wave (GW) astronomy. 
The package aims to bridge the gap between theoretical CCSN modeling and GW astronomy by providing an accessible solution for data analysis. 
While SynthGrav is specifically designed for supernovae, its versatile framework makes it applicable to any burst source.


## Features

- Easy-to-use Python interface
- Designed for machine learning applications
- Ideal for parameter estimation studies
- Reduces reliance on sparse existing predictions
- Eliminates the need to develop signal-generating software
